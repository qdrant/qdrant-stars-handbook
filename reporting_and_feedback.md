# Reporting and Feedback

Qdrant Stars can help us enhance the program by reporting their activities and providing feedback on what worked well, what could be improved, and any suggestions you may have.

#### Monthly Activity Reporting

Each month, you'll receive an email with a link to a form. Please use the form bellow to report your activities, including:

* Events you've organized or participated in
* Content you've created
* Engagements within the community
* Any challenges you faced
* Suggestions for improving the program

Fill out the quick monthly activity form to share details about your contributions. This information helps us understand your impact and provide even better support. You can access the form here: <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Report and Feedback Form.</span>


### Quarterly Surveys

Every quarter, we'll send you a quick email survey to gather your feedback on the Qdrant Stars program. Share your thoughts on the support you receive, the resources available, and your overall experience. Your input helps us keep improving!

### Bi-Monthly Meetings

These meetings are an opportunity to share updates, discuss challenges, and collaborate on solutions. They also serve as a platform for you to connect with other Stars and share success stories. Participation is highly encouraged and you will receive an invitation with the agenda and virtual meeting link prior to each meeting.
