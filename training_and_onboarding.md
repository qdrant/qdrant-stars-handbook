# Training and Onboarding

To ensure you are fully equipped to succeed as an ambassador, we have a series of initial training sessions and a certification process. This section will guide you through what to expect from the training and how to obtain your Qdrant Stars Certification.

The initial training is designed to familiarize you with Qdrantâ€™s technology, tools, and resources, and are crucial for building your foundation in vector search technology. The training will be delivered through a combination of online modules and live webinars. The online modules can be completed at your own pace, while the webinars will be scheduled and require live participation.
