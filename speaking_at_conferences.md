# Speaking at Conferences

We encourage all Qdrant ambassadors to speak at conferences because it's a great way to spread the word about our technology, build your professional reputation, and connect you with others in the tech community.

## Choosing a Conference:

* Global Opportunities: If you're interested in traveling abroad, aim for well-known conferences that attract industry leaders and influencers. This will maximize your visibility and expand your networking opportunities.
* Local Engagement: We also strongly support speaking at major conferences within your own country to strengthen local connections and boost our presence nearby.

## Let's Make it Happen:

* Guidance on Selecting Conferences: Need help deciding which conferences to attend? Talk to our team or to your peers on the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Qdrant Stars Discord Channel</span> for insights into which events might offer the most benefit based on your expertise.
* Preparing Your Talk: We offer resources to help you prepare impactful presentations. From presentation templates and slides from past talks to essential Qdrant talking points. Plus, enjoy a one-on-one coaching session to polish your presentation with our DevRel team.
* Feedback and Rehearsals: Before the event, you can schedule a rehearsal with our team to run through your talk. You’ll receive constructive feedback to fine-tune your performance, ensuring you deliver your message confidently and effectively.
* Promotional Material: We supply a range of promotional materials like stickers, Qdrant cards, and branded swag to help you engage your audience and leave a mark.
* Post-Conference Support: After the conference, we’d love to hear about your experience. What worked? What could be better? Your insights are invaluable, helping us shape an even stronger support system for your next speaking engagement.
