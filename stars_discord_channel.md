# Stars Discord Channel

We have set up a private dedicated <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Discord server for all Qdrant Stars</span>. This server is your go-to place for daily interactions, support, and sharing. Use the Discord server to ask questions, seek advice, share your successes, and discuss topics related to Qdrant technology with your fellow ambassadors and the Qdrant team.

Need access to the channel? Contact the program manager with your Discord username for the necessary permissions.
