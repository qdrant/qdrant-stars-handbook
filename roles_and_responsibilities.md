## Stars Program OKRs and KPIs

To ensure our program's success and continuous improvement, we've established a set of Objectives and Key Results (OKRs):


### Objective 1: Enhance Community Engagement

* Key Result: Sustain and increase active participation in community discussions and events.


### Objective 2: Empower Stars with Tools and Knowledge

* Key Result: Ensure Stars are satisfied and proficient with the training and resources provided.

### Objective 3: Amplify Qdrant's Brand through Stars’ Activities

* Key Result: Grow the influence and visibility of Qdrant's brand through Stars' activities.

To quantify our progress and impact, we'll monitor the following Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):

* Number of community contributions produced by ambassadors
* Event attendance and engagement metrics (meetups, workshops, conferences)
* Website traffic, social media metrics, media mentions driven by ambassadors
* New user signups and project contributions influenced by ambassador initiatives
* Industry events featuring Qdrant ambassador speakers
* Ambassador community engagement (forum activity, knowledge-sharing sessions, collaboration projects)
* Ambassador satisfaction and retention rates

While these OKRs and KPIs serve as a framework for measuring our collective success, we recognize that the real essence of your participation isn't captured fully by these metrics. We encourage you to immerse yourself deeply in the community, collaborate with freedom, and share your expertise generously.
